## What I learned

### Packages

- [`flutter_native_splash`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_native_splash) package for splash screen.
- [`flutter_svg`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_svg) package for using a SVG icon.
- [`flutter_staggered_grid_view`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_staggered_grid_view) package for a grid view to layout an item with content sized height.

### Widgets

- `PageView` widget for a carousel images using a calculated `viewportFraction` of `PageController` to calculate spacing that depends on the image width.
  - For an each image, `viewportFraction = (horizontalPadding * 2 + itemWidth) / pageViewWidth`
- Difference of `viewInset`, `padding`, `viewPadding` that is a property of `MediaQueryData`.
  - `viewInset` : The parts of the display that are completely obscured by system UI, typically by the device's keyboard.
  - `viewPadding` : The parts of the display that are partially obscured by system UI, typically by the hardware display nothces or the system status bar.
  - `padding` : calculated results from `max(0.0, viewPadding - viewInset)`
  - Use `viewPadding` to get a static screen inset.
